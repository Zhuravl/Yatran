Yatran is a typing tutor designed to help children improve their typing speed in an engaging way.

The app is named after the
famous ["Yatran" typewriter](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C_(%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0)),
which was produced by the Ukrainian "Drukmash" factory in the second half of the 20th century.

To play the game, users are required to type at a speed of over 200 characters per minute (or 40 words per minute), with
up to 10% of mistakes allowed. Players can adjust the game's difficulty by choosing different levels, which offer more
variety in terms of the characters to be typed.
